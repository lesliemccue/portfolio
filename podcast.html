				<h2> PODCAST</h2>
				<p> Along with my college work I have completed so far, in my spare time I have co-hosted, been the creative director and editor of a podcast named Whine Time. Myself and my good friend Lara Kelly came up with the idea of starting the podcast together in August of 2020 shortly after moving in to a new apartment together. The podcast is a light hearted, easy listen aimed at people aged between 18-30. One of the elements of each episode is that we drink a bottle of wine each and pick a topic to discuss each week.</p>
				<p>To date we have 26 full episodes with over 4,000 downloads. Every week after recording I edit and upload the episode to all major platforms such as <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/479OxcD6a8DFjqviyQnMAW?si=uaAhMMwhTDKVu9dkk6y2Xg">Spotify</a>  and <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/ie/podcast/whinetime/id1527831196">Apple Podcasts</a>.  Below I have attached a promotional video which was made for us by the very talented Nicole Goodman.

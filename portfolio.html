				<h1 class="port"> GRAPHIC DESIGN</h1>
				<br>
				<br>
				<p class="par">Since beginning my journey in the creative digital media course I have discovered a love for graphic design. I have always admired the work of graphic designers but I never considered it an area that I would like to work in, however after learning illustator and photoshop I have found a new love for graphic design and it is an area I would love to explore more in the future. For my first year project I created a poster for the college course, it was my first time using illurstrator for a project and I was really happy with how it turned out. <br>
				For the first semester in my second year I created a book cover and also a full 12 page magazine. I got an A grade for my work which I was delighted with! Examples of my graphic design work can be found below.</p>

				<h1 class="port"> FILM</h1>
				<br>
				<br>
				<p class="par"> Film Making is an area that I have always had a great interest in. The main reason I chose to apply for creative digital media was to explore my love for film and see if it was a root I would like to go down career wise, which I was happy to discover it is. I am fascinated by the amount of work and skill that goes into any film or TV programme. We have had to cmplete several tasks throughout the film module. For most of them unfortunately we have been in lockdown so I haven't managed to get the full experience in filming just yet. Below I have linked a scene analysis which was an assigment I had to complete. It made me really think in depth about camera angles.</p>

			 <h1 class="port"> PHOTOGRAPHY</h1>
				<br>
				<br>
				<p class="par">As of recent I have discovered a new love for photography. I got a reusable disposable camera as a birthday present and since I got it I haven't been able to put it down! I would definetely love commit more of my spare time to taking pictures and maybe even start an Instagram page dedicated to it. Until then however I have linked my gallery <a href="gallery.html">here</a> for you to have a look at some of the pictures I have taken. All of them were taken on my phone. </p>
				
				<h1 class="port"> AUDIO</h1>
				<br>
				<br>
				<p class="par">Audio is an area I have a bit more experience in since I have had a podcast for the past several months. I have linked more information <a href="podcast.html"> here</a>. I am in the middle of making an audio documentary for this semester. I have based it around the topic of 'Good Habits/Bad Habits'. When it is all finished I will add it to this portfolio page!  </p>

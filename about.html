    <h2>ABOUT</h2>
	  <br>
    <p>My name is Leslie McCue and I am a 22 year old student from Co.Meath studying Creative Digital Media in TU Dublin. I am currently in my second year of the course. I have always loved being creative ever since I was young. When I began researching college courses a couple of years ago creative digital media really stood out to me. <br>
				Since starting the course I have gained a lot of knowledge and skills in various different outlets.</p>

    <h2>HOBBIES</h2>
	  <br>
    <p>In my spare time my favourite thing to do is relax and watch YouTube videos! It really helps me switch off after a long day. Since lockdown I have started playing guitar again to pass the time. I taught myself how to play the basics a few years ago but never stuck at it but thankfully I have found my love for it again. <br>
	I am also a big foodie and love trying out different receipes whenever I have some spare time.</p>
